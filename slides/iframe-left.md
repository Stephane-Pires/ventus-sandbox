In ancient Greek religion and myth, the Anemoi (Greek: Ἄνεμοι, 'Winds') were wind gods who were each ascribed a cardinal direction from which their respective winds came (see Classical compass winds), and were each associated with various seasons and weather conditions, in a similar manner to modern meteorological terms like Nor'easter, storms which depend on the complex interaction of air masses in a particular region.
